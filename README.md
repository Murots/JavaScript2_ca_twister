### Running

## Changes/problems

I think JavaScript was difficult to understand in the first year. In the JavaScript2 course there was a lot of new things to get used to. What I experienced as the most difficult was seeing the big picture between the modules and the content of CA along the way. Fortunately, the pieces fell into place towards the end, and I also feel I had a small breakthrough about JS while working on the CA itself. A concrete example of a problem I spent a lot of time on was filtering out the relevant posts for my feed, based on all posts from the API. I eventually understood that I had to sort by a constant title, as this is a special situation where many people send posts to the same server, but with different goals in mind.
